Description:
    This package provides a set of functions useful in the analysis
    of 3D genomic interactions. It includes the import of
    standard HiC data formats into R and HiC normalisation procedures.
    The main objective of this package is to improve the visualization and
    quantification of the analysis of HiC contacts through aggreagtion.
